# ðŸ§  Deep Learning Tasks

A comprehensive collection of deep learning tasks and experiments, organized by AI domains. This repository serves as a structured portfolio showcasing my progress and implementations across various deep learning fields.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- **Build a structured DL portfolio** with organized experiments and implementations
- **Practice implementing models** across different AI domains (Computer Vision, NLP, Speech, Generative Models, etc.)
- **Track progress systematically** with detailed checklists and documentation
- **Create reusable components** including code, datasets, and training pipelines for future projects
- **Document my deep learning journey** with clear progress tracking and learning insights

**Note**: This repository documents my personal deep learning journey and progress. Each task includes detailed implementation notes, learning insights, and experimental results.
