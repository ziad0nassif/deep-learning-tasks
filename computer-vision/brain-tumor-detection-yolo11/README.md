# Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv11

A deep learning project for automated brain tumor detection in medical images using the state-of-the-art YOLOv11 object detection model.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements a brain tumor detection system by fine-tuning YOLOv11-medium on medical imaging data. The model achieves high accuracy in identifying and localizing brain tumors, making it a valuable tool for medical diagnosis assistance.

## üìä Performance Metrics

Our fine-tuned YOLOv11 model achieved exceptional performance:

- **Precision**: 97.93%
- **Recall**: 94.60%
- **mAP@0.5**: 97.66%
- **mAP@0.5:0.95**: 71.51%

These metrics demonstrate the model's reliability in accurately detecting brain tumors while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

The project uses a curated brain tumor dataset from Roboflow:
- **Source**: [Tumor Detection Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/selencakmak/tumor-dj2a1)
- **Format**: YOLOv11 compatible annotations


## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Data Preparation
```python
from roboflow import Roboflow

# Initialize Roboflow with your API key
rf = Roboflow(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
project = rf.workspace("ziad-nassif").project("tumor-vliim-k1cjm")
version = project.version(1)
dataset = version.download("yolov11")
```

### 2. Model Training
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load YOLOv11-medium pretrained model
model = YOLO("yolo11m.pt")

# Train the model
model.train(
    data="/path/to/your/Tumor-1/data.yaml",
    epochs=200,
    imgsz=512,
    batch=16,
    device=0,
    verbose=False
)
```

### 3. Model Inference
```python
# Load trained model
model = YOLO("runs/detect/train102/weights/best.pt")

# Run inference on new images
results = model("path/to/test/image.jpg")
results[0].show()  # Display results
```
